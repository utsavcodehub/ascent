Job seekers these days make additional preparations for answering interview questions forgetting that questions can be asked to the interviewer too. Asking the right questions can place you in a positive side; increasing chances of the job offer.

Ask questions keeping in mind the discussions held during the interview. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">It is very important to prepare in advance the questions you would like to ask an interviewer. The quality of questions asked reflect greatly on your capabilities. In no case should you be asking \u201cnon-serious questions\u201d like work timings, number of holidays per year etc. The questions have to be serious and related to the overall organization, its culture, job-profile related etc. Also, you need to pay total attention and concentration to the interview discussions to avoid question\/s that have already been clarified during the entire interview session. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">Asking questions doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t know your job, asking questions means you want to improve the quality of your work. \u2013 Robert Allen<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">While preparing the list of questions, focus on the 6 Ws viz. What, When, Where, Why, Who, and ho\u2019W\u2019. During an interview, one should consider asking the interviewer the below mentioned types of questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana; font-size: 18px;\">What is the company\u2019s culture like?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">When you\u2019ve acquired a new opportunity in a new company, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the targetted role and the team you will be working for. Showing your interest is a positive approach and employers are eager to hire professionals who are keen in participating with fellow colleagues and managers. This is one of the important questions to ask as it shows your interest and care about your work place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana; font-size: 18px;\">How is performance measured?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">Performance is measured differently at every organization. Employers seek individuals who are results-oriented and motivated towards the job\/task allotted. When it comes to judging your performance you need to know whether your performance will be measured solely or on net contributions hence, questions regarding performance measurements need to be asked. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana; font-size: 18px;\">What training opportunities do you offer?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">This question highlights on your keen interest in advancing your skills thereby adding value to yourself and the organization.

Job roles may keep changing as per the requirements, but it should match your skill-set. If the role is in the same function or different to acquire a larger exposure, then accepting the same would be a better idea. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana; font-size: 18px;\">What type of career-planning does the organization have for its employees?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"western\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000;\">This question when asked emphasizes one\u2019s determination to make progress while keeping the company position firm over the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] Being inquisitive during an interview will help you in taking the right decision for both career enhancement and handling work pressure.
