Hence, it is better to mend these mistakes before it is too late!<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A flawless resume can open the doors of opportunity; similarly, a low quality\/ wrongly written resume can close a lot of doors. Listed below are the most common pitfalls and also how you can avoid the same:<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Typos, Spellings and Grammatical Errors<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Grammatically perfect resume can draw the attention of the recruiters. If your resume has grammatical errors, the chances of resume rejection are higher. An incorrect resume would portray an incorrect image and a wrong impression with incomplete conclusions. Hence, you need to have a perfect draft of resume with zero grammatical error. This is most easily done through spell checks on your computer software.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Not Providing Specific Information<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Employers need a clear understanding on what you have achieved in your career. They need to know of your performance and achievements for yourself and for your employers. It is important to specify how productive you have been, how your performance has been fruitful for your organization and what recognition you have got for the same.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Attempting One Size Fits All<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Writing a one-size-fits-all resume could end up in rejection. An Employer expects a perfect resume which is specific to the job role and also how well you fit the position. The more specific &amp; tailor-made your resume is, the better is the chance to get viewed by the recruiter.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Highlighting Job Responsibilities Instead of Accomplishments<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Maintaining one mode of writing process is very simple; wherein you highlight only your job responsibilities. Mentioning this is not a big deal, anyone and everyone can do that. However, employers are more keen in knowing what have you accomplished while performing those responsibilities. Also, during your tenure in the organization, what has the organization benefitted because of you.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Going on Too Long or Cutting Things Too Short<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">There is no hard and fast rule for a resume length. Why? The reason is human beings with different preferences and expectations will still read it. Well, it doesn\u2019t mean you should send out 3\/ 4\/ 5-page resumes. From the recruiter\u2019s point of view, what he expects is a crisp but complete resume, which is to the point and covers whole of your skills and experience. Hence, it generally is said that you need to limit yourself to a maximum of two-pages. But you need to make sure that you have covered all that is needed to be mentioned. Your knowledge is your dish; it is in your hands how well you present it! Writing a two page resume and at the same time covering all the information is a tedious job, just ensure you cut short the info without losing the essence of it.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Vague Job-Objectives \/ KRAs<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Employers scan your resume thoroughly, hence you need to avoid vague or general objective. Stick to tailor-made objectives which mention about specialization using key skills and applying the same for any specific role. A more personalized objective that focuses on the recruiter\u2019s needs would attract their eyes.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">No Action Verbs<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Usage of action verbs in the resume is more effective and acceptable. Avoid phrases like \u201cresponsible for\u201d and \u201caccountable for\u201d, instead use verbs that will have more impact on the reader like achieved, rewarded, etc.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Volunteering Additional Information<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">You may have taken up a few part-time or extra moon-lighting assignments to earn some more money, please don\u2019t be tempted to add them in your resume. This would portray a bad image about you in the reader\u2019s mind. However, you can add the soft skills acquired through such experience for instance: work ethic, time management, etc.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Visually Unappealing\/Tiring: too many graphics, photographs, fonts, highlighted details<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Over-designing and decorating your resume with different fonts and colors may look good to you but not to the recruiter. It\u2019s too disturbing for the recruiter\u2019s eye; hence, may lose interest in even reading it. It is always safe to keep the paper black and white with a suitable font size which is soothing to the eyes. Make sure you show and consult with others or professionals before sending the final draft ahead. Writing too much in the resume may make it look too busy, it\u2019s advisable to write the most important information and maintain a minimum 2 pages resume.<\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" align=\"justify\">Incorrect Contact Information<\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">The content of your resume may be incredibly strong, but if your contact information is incorrect then it would be no good to you. Always ensure all the information you have mentioned in the resume is correct &amp; updated\/latest, including your contact numbers, as it is the only source for the recruiters to get connected to you. Best thing to do is always double-check even the most minute details to avoid missing an opportunity!<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; [vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] \u201dA stitch in time saves nine!\u201d Well said and applies to us as most of us take it for granted that resume writing is no big deal\u2026.but we have never known the mistakes we make while writing one.
